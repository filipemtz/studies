# TIC TAC TOE Game using React 

This the basic example from React's website. The basic structure of directories is downloaded from the [CodeSandbox in the Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#setup-for-the-tutorial). The only change I did was to store the components in a proper directory.

## Installing Dependencies  

npm install

## Running 

npm start
